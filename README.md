#Chess

Built a functional chess game with correct game logic.
Currently, working on building a computer AI.

`ruby game.rb`

<underline>Computer AI notes</underline>
- AI plays defense well, but cannot make smart offensive moves
- Completed one full game against AI to checkmate with no failures
- Need to build strategy for the beginning of the game
